⚠️ This is my first Rust project 🚀, I would appreciate any feedback to improve my code. ⚠️

**[WIP]** Genshin Impact artifact generator, as the name suggests it generates 5* artifacts from the game `Genshin Impact` like if
you were farming from Domains. Following 1:1 the probabilities indicated in
[Genshin Impact Wiki](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Genshin_Impact_Wiki) as well most of the documentation is
taken from the mentioned website 💖.

[Jyo's Spiral Abyss Guides](https://www.youtube.com/@jyolikearock_)'s
